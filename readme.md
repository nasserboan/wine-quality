# Wine Quality

![wine](wine.png)

This is the last project for the course 'Fundamentos da Inteligência Artificial". The main purpose of this project is to implement a MultiLayerPerceptron (MLP) model using data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

For this project I chose the Wine Quality dataset that describe more than 4898 different variants of 'Vinho verde' wine. In this project I will train a MLP model that can predict the quality of a given wine.
